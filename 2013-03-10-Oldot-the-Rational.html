    <div class="post-title">Oldot the Rational</div>
    <div class="post-date">Sunday, March 10 &#39;13</div>

    <p>In a certain district in San Francisco which I do not wish to name, there lived a gentleman.  His household consisted of himself and his possessions, and sometimes a tabby cat &mdash; of the ugliest, large eyed variety &mdash; that he did not own but would find trapped in his apartment due to the negligence of his neighbors.</p>

<p>Our gentleman was verging on twenty five, of pleasant face, naturally vigorous constitution, a frightfully early riser.  It was necessary to shift his circadian rhythms.  They say his name was Oldot, though we are skeptical.  Of his surname it is not known.</p>

<p>The reader must know that this gentleman strove wholeheartedly, put perhaps unconciously, to be the most rational of men.  He gave himself up to the honorable profession of engineering software in the most straightforward way.  Oldot, we must admit, was not a very clever man; not once was he known to have tried a solution that was uncharted.  But this did not matter much, and in fact was to his credit, because novelty took time and failure a mop and broom.  So it was satifactory to all that Oldot never compromised his efficiency if he could help it.</p>

<p>This attitude filtered into almost everything Oldot did: He was continuously avoiding his neighbors, who he found to be too old or too young, or too unlike him to interact with in a satisfactory way.</p>

<p>Only with his landlady, who lived at arms reach from his mailbox, was he the least bit talkative; but only because it was in his interest to be.</p>

<p>Oldot had few friends in this world.  Anderson, another engineer, would enter his household regularly on the pretence of discussing the very best spandex running shorts.  These discussions would go on for countless minutes, eventually always turning into heated rebukes in which personal experience was thrown around willy-nilly like a switch blade knife, and after a time they would see the damage they had done, would embrace with meaning and find softer topics like the use of plantains in fried dishes.  Occassionally one friend would announce a new software library they had found amusing or a text editor feature that had inspired a sweet little macro with custom key-bindings.  But for the most part this talk of work was not enjoyable unless there was a serious problem at hand.  And this was simply impossible when Anderson was welcome, on weekends, because of the highest priority was vigorous exercise and rest.</p>

<p>One fine San Francisco morning &mdash; it was one of those bright Tuesdays &mdash; Oldot found himself wiping the steam valve stem of his espresso machine with unusual care, wondering in an uncharacteristic fashion what his life might have been if he had taken up a profession as fruitless as that of a writer.  Or journalist, he imagined they said nowadays.  Apart from the useful 4 paragraph blog stints like &ldquo;How to Book a Cheap Cruise&rdquo; and &ldquo;Braces, Mending Plates, &amp; Shelf Brackets&rdquo;, he felt very strongly that the rightful place for serious writers was Project Gutenburg and minimum wage coffee shops.  So it is even more shocking that he thought of himself, even for a moment so brief, in a position of one of these irrational &mdash; might we be so bold as to say downright unintelligent individuals, who expended so much engergy for so little return.</p>

<p>He was very pleased with where modern writing was going, towards more facts and less nonsense.  And that was that.</p>

<p>That morning Oldot&rsquo;s office was as excellent to him as it always was, for there were highly straightforward people who were quite willing to talk of memory leaks, leeks, and encryption proxies.  And when most appropriate, there was not one but three dessert restaurants within walking distance (had had recently been convinced that one was not enough).  In its most unexcellent aspects &mdash; those few strange individuals who were long winded, confusing folk &mdash; Oldot responsded handsomely by nodding his blank face and then complimenting their very small european cars.</p>

<p>No one bothered him today, not even to ask how was &ldquo;doing&rdquo; &mdash; which he found a downright superficial question.  So he settled into his customized ergnomic seat thinking how on all accounts this morning could still turn out to be execellent.</p>

<p>One might notice that there would be no point in telling the reader of this morning if it turned out to be such an oridinary one.  Unless of course the goal is to send the reader down the rabbit hole wondering why they ever got so small and how they ended up talking with caterpillars.  No, this morning was definitely not an ordinary one, and finally at half past eleven, just as the company email had been sent out with a lunch announcement of seasoned squirrel food, did the event of our interest take place.</p>
